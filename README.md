## Email Alert Functionality

The application includes an email alert system to notify users when a borrowed book is due in 10 days. This feature helps users remember to return books on time. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of how it works:

1. **Borrowing a Book**: When a book is borrowed, the return date is set to 30 days later.
2. **Calculating Remaining Days**: The application calculates the number of days remaining until the return date.
3. **Sending Alerts**: If there are 10 days left, the application sends an email reminder to the user's email address provided during sign-up. This is handled using Python's `smtplib` and `email` modules.
